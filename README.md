# SMSKite

This is an application that allows you to send text messages through Twilio to multiple phone numbers.

After downloading the code and adding your own Twilio Account SID and Auth Token to the SMSKite.java file, you can create a build of the project
(I used Apache NetBeans) that will give you a JAR file containing the application and all of it's dependencies.

When you run that JAR file, simply input the phone numbers you would like to text (separated by commas for multiple recipients), add your message to the 
message box, and hit send!
